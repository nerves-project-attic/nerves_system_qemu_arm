# Old README.md

This is the original README from when QEMU support was very manual and unlike
the other targets. It has some really good information in it that may be useful
to others especially for getting bridged networking to work.

This is the start of a QEMU configuration. Instructions are given below
to make networking work on Linux and OS X QEMU hosts.

## Booting

### Hello, Nerves!

Here follows a baseline example of how to run the Nerves [getting started
example](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/getting-started.html) on QEMU:

```
# Create a project
mix nerves.new hello_nerves --target qemu_arm

# Build it
cd hello_nerves && mix deps.get && mix firmware

# Create the base image. This will be used for the virtual SDCard to the
# emulator.
fwup -a -d _images/qemu_arm/hello_nerves.img -i _images/qemu_arm/hello_nerves.fw -t complete

# Run Qemu
qemu-system-arm -M vexpress-a9 -m 1024M -kernel images/u-boot -drive file=images/nerves_system_qemu_arm.img,if=sd,format=raw -net nic,model=lan9118 -net user,hostfwd=tcp::9898-:9898

If all goes well, you will shortly see the QEMU graphical monitor console
pop up, displaying the Nerves logo in the top left corner and running an
interactive Elixir shell (IEx):

## Networking

To enable networking with Nerves on QEMU, you will need to do more elaborate
setup, and you will require superuser (i.e., root) privileges.

### Networking on OS X

**Note:** These instructions are up to date as of OS X El Capitan 10.11.6.
In the following, `en0` is assumed to be your primary physical OS X network
interface (Ethernet or Wi-Fi), and `bridge1` a virtual bridge interface that
we'll create for use with QEMU. In case those interface names don't work for
you, adjust all instructions accordingly. Similarly, the subnet
192.168.78.1/24 is an arbitrary choice for example purposes, change it as
you please.

*Kudos to [@salessandri](https://github.com/salessandri) for his guide to
[setting up a NAT network for QEMU on OS
X](https://blog.san-ss.com.ar/2016/04/setup-nat-network-for-qemu-macosx)
on which the following is based.*

#### 1. TunTap drivers

Install the [TunTap](http://tuntaposx.sourceforge.net/) kernel extensions
either manually from SourceForge or directly with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

    $ sudo brew cask install tuntap

Note that `sudo` is required in the above, as these kernel extensions will
get installed into the system paths `/Library/Extensions/{tap,tun}.kext`.

Now load the `tun`/`tap` kernel extensions, and ensure that they will get
automatically loaded on startup when your machine is rebooted in the future:

    $ sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.sf.tuntaposx.tap.plist
    $ sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.sf.tuntaposx.tun.plist

#### 2. Bridge interface

Create and configure a virtual network bridge interface `bridge1` for QEMU,
connecting the bridge to your primary physical network interface `en0` and
configuring it to use its own /24 subnet:

    $ sudo ifconfig bridge1 create
    $ sudo ifconfig bridge1 addm en0
    $ sudo ifconfig bridge1 192.168.78.1/24   # 78 = ?N

#### 3. Packet forwarding and NAT

Configure your Mac such that packets arriving from the `bridge1` interface
are routed correctly, and enable NAT such that response packets find their
way back:

    $ curl -OL https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_qemu_arm/raw/develop/qemu-pf.conf

    $ sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
    $ sudo pfctl -F all              # flush existing rules
    $ sudo pfctl -f qemu-pf.conf     # load NAT rules for bridge1

(Note that `pfctl -F all` also flushes any other rules, unrelated to QEMU.
If you know how to improve this, please contribute a README improvement.)

#### 4. DHCP configuration

As a last prerequisite, let's set up
[Dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) to handle DHCP
requests on the `bridge1` interface. Dnsmasq is available via both Homebrew
and MacPorts. The following depicts installation from Homebrew:

    $ brew install dnsmasq

    $ curl -OL https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_qemu_arm/raw/develop/qemu-dnsmasq.conf

    $ dnsmasq --conf-file=qemu-dnsmasq.conf  # daemonizes into the background

### Networking on Linux

**Note:** These instructions are valid for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Xenial Xerus,
which uses QEMU version 2.5.0. In the following, `eth0` is assumed to be the
machine's primary physical network interface (Ethernet or Wi-Fi), and
`bridge1` a virtual bridge interface that we'll create for use with QEMU. If
those interface names don't work for you, adjust all instructions accordingly.
Similarly, the subnet 192.168.0.0/24 is arbitrary; change it as required

Development and testing was conducted on a remote machine over `ssh -X` for
X-Windows forwarding.

#### 1. Prerequisites

Install QEMU and the network bridge utilities:

    $ sudo apt-get install qemu-system-arm bridge-utils

#### 2. Bridge interface configuration

This was done on an Intel NUC computer connected via Ethernet to a home
network and configured with a static IP address. The network is assumed
to have a DHCP server on it somewhere, which will provide network config
information to the QEMU guest.

Edit (as root) `/etc/network/interfaces` to look something like this:

```
# interfaces(5) file used by ifup(8) and ifdown(8)
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet manual

auto bridge1
iface bridge1 inet static
  address 192.168.0.110         # static IP of linux host
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  gateway 192.168.0.1           # router
  dns-nameservers 192.168.0.1   # router again
  dns-search lan local
  bridge_ports eth0
  bridge_stp off
  bridge_fd 0
  bridge_maxwait 0
```

Reboot the machine.

#### 3. Tap interface configuration

In conjunction with the networking setup in `/etc/network/interfaces` above,
set up a tap interface joined to the main bridge. This will provide the QEMU
(nerves) guest with an appearance on the LAN. Other configurations are
possible using routed or NAT-ed "back-end" networks, but not covered here.

**Note:** These commands are automatically executed by the `qemu-ifup.sh`
script referenced below. `qemu-ifdown.sh` tears down the tap interface once
the VM exits. If you already hav a `tap0` interface on your machine, you'll
want to choose something else.

    # create the tap interface
    $ sudo ip tuntap add dev tap0 mode tap user `whoami`

    # enable the tap interface
    $ sudo ip link set tap0 up

    # add tap interface to existing bridge
    $ sudo brctl addif bridge1 tap0


### Hello, Network!

Now you're ready to proceed to building and booting up the Nerves
[hello_network](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves-examples/tree/master/hello_network)
example:

    $ git clone https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves-examples.git

    $ cd nerves-examples/hello_network

    $ curl -OL https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_qemu_arm/raw/develop/qemu-ifup.sh
    $ curl -OL https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_qemu_arm/raw/develop/qemu-ifdown.sh

    $ NERVES_TARGET=qemu_arm mix deps.get

    $ NERVES_TARGET=qemu_arm mix firmware

    $ fwup -a -d _images/qemu_arm/hello_network.img -i _images/qemu_arm/hello_network.fw -t complete

    $ sudo qemu-system-arm -M vexpress-a9 -smp 1 -m 256                    \
        -kernel _build/qemu_arm/dev/nerves/system/images/zImage            \
        -dtb _build/qemu_arm/dev/nerves/system/images/vexpress-v2p-ca9.dtb \
        -drive file=_images/qemu_arm/hello_network.img,if=sd,format=raw    \
        -append "console=ttyAMA0,115200 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2" -serial stdio \
        -net nic,model=lan9118                                             \
        -net tap,ifname=tap0,script=qemu-ifup.sh,downscript=qemu-ifdown.sh

Once booted up into the IEX console, you can verify that network connectivity and
DNS name resolution works by typing in:

    iex(1)> HelloNetwork.test_dns
    {:ok,
     {:hostent, 'nerves-project.org', [], :inet, 4,
      [{192, 30, 252, 154}, {192, 30, 252, 153}]}}

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add nerves_system_qemu_arm to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:nerves_system_qemu_arm, "~> 0.11.0"}]
        end

  2. Ensure nerves_system_qemu_arm is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:nerves_system_qemu_arm]]
        end

## Starting a local web browser for use as a kiosk
